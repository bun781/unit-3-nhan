Q1. What was the most proud moment for you during this project?
I submitted the project on time this time!!! Also when the screen template worked.

Q2. What worked well this time
I started actually recorded my task, so the time management was a bit better this time.

Q3. What will you do different for unit 4/ IA
I will start the documentation (especially criterion c) sooner, and not leave my video until the product is really finished (take multiple videos throughout the process). I slept at 3am on the last day because I wanted to make the video when everything was finished.
I will make the evidence of client consultation earlier so I don't forget it.
I will add more comparisons in the proposed solution and criterion c. On criterion C focus more on the things that I have created and compare it with alternatives as well as discuss its benefits.

Q4. What do you need help with
I need help with criterion c, especially selecting which techniques to include and how to distribute my 1000 words. Also, I wonder if there is a certain structure that I can follow.
